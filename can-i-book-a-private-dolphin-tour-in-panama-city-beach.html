Feeding activities usually take place on an outgoing tide. Panama City Beach Dolphin Tours is a great option. They are on the water almost every day of year.</p><p>Although you may have seen dolphins in captivity in a marine park or aquarium, it is much more fascinating to see these magnificent animals in their natural habitat. Even though wild dolphin behavior cannot be predicted, and sightings on all trips are not guaranteed, tour captains have a lot of experience on the waters of St. Andrew Bay almost every day. <i>Compass</i>  Our captains know where dolphins can be found, and they do everything possible to ensure guests have a good time. Dolphins can be seen on most tours jumping, playing, looking for food and communicating with each other.</p></div>
