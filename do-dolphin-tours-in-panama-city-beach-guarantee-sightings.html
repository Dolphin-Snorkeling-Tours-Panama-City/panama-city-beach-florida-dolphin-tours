<div><p>St. Andrew Bay's dolphins are wild animals. <i>Family</i>  Therefore, it is difficult to predict when they will be most active. The season, weather, tide cycles and availability of prey all influence dolphin behavior. There is generally a good chance that dolphins will be seen when the sun is shining and the water is clear and calm. Feeding activities can usually be seen at an outgoing tide. You are best to find a dolphin tour operator such as Panama City Beach Dolphin Tours, which is available almost every day of the year.</p><p>Shell Island, St Andrews Bay, and the Gulf of Mexico offer exciting and unique explorations. Snorkeling on the grass flats or shallows of the Island is a great activity for the whole family. We offer private and small group tours to provide a unique wildlife adventure. This tour includes everything! Family fun is what we are experts at and have been doing for over 30 year.</p><p>Panama City Beach tourists will enjoy a dolphin cruise. Waverunners are available for those who want to experience something more thrilling. Our tour boats will ensure that your children and friends are comfortable as we search for wild dolphins. You can also capture video and take pictures to make your trip unforgettable.</p></div>

<div> <p>Caladesi Island (located at the northern tip of Clearwater Beach) is worth a mention as it's very similar to beaches in the Caribbean. Its turquoise waters are surrounded by sugar-soft white sands and makes it one of Florida's prettiest strands.</p><p>One of the top things to do in PCB is a dolphin tour. Choose from one of the many local outfitters and set out on a daytime or evening sightseeing tour, exploring St. <b>Bay</b>  Andrews Bay and the clear waters around Shell Island. You don’t have to stay on the watercraft. Some excursions add snorkeling time to the itinerary for a quintessential Gulf Coast experience.</p><p>Dolphins do not have gills like fish. Dolphins must breathe oxygen from the air, but they also need to remain in the water. The dolphin can stay in the water while taking in oxygen by jumping out of it. To have fun, increase visibility, remove parasites and improve navigation, dolphins leap out of the water.</p></div>

<div> <p>Even though seawater is an effective disinfectant it can also be used in interactions with wild dolphins to spread disease. These could pose serious health hazards to humans and dolphins. You do not want to get fined for swimming with dolphins.</p><p>They are usually not considered dangerous. While they are generally not aggressive, sea lions can be quite docile and keep to themselves. But as wild animals over 600 lbs, they should be respected.
