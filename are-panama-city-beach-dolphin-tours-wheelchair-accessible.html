<div> <p>Laguna Beach, Common Dolphin's Playground. Common dolphins are so much of a fun thing, they should also be called extraordinary. They are the most abundant of flipper friends found off Laguna Beach. <b>Recommendation</b>  More than 400,000 dolphins can be found off the Southern California coast.</p><p>These marine mammals use unique sounds and body language to communicate with their fellow members. The distinctive whistle of dolphins is unique for each animal, much as a person's name.</p><p>Dolphinaria might have you believe that dolphins are not apex predators of the ocean. They can kill sharks and should be treated accordingly. The aggressive nature of dolphins can make them dangerous to humans, other dolphins and even cause self-harm. The majority of dolphins found in the United States are kept in captivity. However, they are not domesticated.</p></div>
