<div><p>Florida Bay is home to Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphins. It is the largest body in the Everglades. This brackish, shallow water body is home to approximately 450 resident dolphins. Their best friend? Hire an Airboat to see these beautiful creatures in their Everglades habitat.</p><p>A dolphin tour can also be a great sightseeing opportunity. All tour boats depart Adventure at Sea in Lower Grand Lagoon. They cruise south and cross the pass between St. Andrew Bay, the Gulf of Mexico and Shell Island. While you can take in the beautiful view, spot seabirds and possibly a turtle, keep your eyes open for dolphins.</p><p>Swim with Dolphins Panama City Beach and Dolphin Encounter programs allow you to meet these highly intelligent animals up close.

<div> <p>Florida's freshwater fish can be consumed without any harm. Mercury levels are low in marine fish like Bluegill, Redear sunfish and Redbreast Sunfish.</p><p>To satisfy their curiosity, dolphins might swim alongside boats. Dolphins are often drawn to the wake of a boat, which causes a disturbance on the surface of the water. They will jump out of the water and appear to be playing in the wake when they do this.</p><p>Although it may be possible to view captive dolphins at a Marine Park, it is much more enjoyable to see them when they are free and healthy in their natural habitat. While wild dolphins can be unpredictable and sightings may not occur on every trip, our captains have been on the waters of St. Andrew Bay for years. They are experts in the locations where dolphins might be found. Our captains will ensure that you have a wonderful time. Dolphins can often be seen playing, searching out food, and communicating with one other on most tours.</p> <b>Twilight</b></div>

<div> <p>Dolphins are able to breathe through their blowhole located on the top portion of their head. The interesting thing about dolphins is that they can still experience respiratory irritation. It could result in the equivalent to someone coughing or sneezing. The dolphins' coughing experience is called "chuffing".</p><p>A dolphin tour is fun for all Panama City Beach visitors. If you’re looking for a more adventurous ride, we can take Waverunners on our journey. If you have young kids or members of your party that just want to kick back and relax, our tour boats can make sure that everyone rides in comfort as we search out wild dolphins. Also you can take pictures, video, and make sure that your trip is one to remember!</p><p>"We had a great experience! Captain Dave was fantastic. He took us to a place where dolphins are often seen.
