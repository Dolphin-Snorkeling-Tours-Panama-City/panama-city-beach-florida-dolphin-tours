<div><p>While you might have seen dolphins at sea in a marine reserve, it is still far more fun to observe these majestic animals in their natural environment. Our captains are experienced in the waterways of St. Andrew Bay and can predict wild dolphin behavior, but they cannot guarantee sightings. Our captains are familiar with the best places to find dolphins and will make sure that guests have a blast. You will see dolphins playing, hunting for food, communicating and jumping on all tours.</p><p>When is the best time of year to see dolphins? From late May to early August, you may be able to spot the most dolphins. You'll see dolphins most often between 10 a.m. to noon, then from 2 pm until it gets dark.</p><p>Henderson Beach State Park, Destin, Florida. Bay St. Louis Beach. Bay St. Louis Beach. Mississippi.
