<div> <p>The Gulf of Mexico's clear waters will allow you to feel the ocean spray as your body zips across them in search of dolphins. Dolphin & Snorkeling Tours Panama City Beach partnered with Adventures at Sea to offer a Jet Ski experience. You'll be accompanied by a guide and will learn all about the most interesting spots. Even if this is your first time riding a Jet Ski, it's easy to pick up the basics from an experienced guide. <i>Recommendation</i>  Adventures at Sea also offers a dolphinboat cruise to Shell Island.</p><p>The trick is to attract dolphins by making them float and adding some pilchards, Spanish sardines, or ballyhoo to the water. This is a fuel-efficient way of scoring, all while you sit around and chat with your friends and listen to some music.</p><p>Dolphins do not have gills like fish. Dolphins have to be able to both breathe oxygen from air and remain in water. Jumping from the water allows dolphins to be dry and take in oxygen. Dolphins leap from the water to enjoy, to enhance visibility, to remove parasites or improve navigation.</p></div>
