<div> <p>A dolphin tour is a top activity in PCB. Pick from one of many local outfitters, and you'll be on your way to a daytime or night sightseeing tour. You will explore St. Andrews Bay as well as the clear waters around Shell Island.<br><br><h2>Panama City Beach dolphin excursions - Recommendation</h2><ul><li>Gulf</li><li>Bay</li><li>Peaceful</li><li>Moonlight</li><li>Compass</li><li>Account</li><li>Sunset</li><li>Binoculars</li><li>Voyage</li><li>Endorsement</li><li>Boats</li><li>Experience</li><li>Tours</li><li>Crew</li><li>Expedition</li></ul> It doesn't mean you have to stay on the watercraft. You can add snorkeling to your itinerary for the ultimate Gulf Coast experience.</p><p>In order to protect the well-being of these wonderful marine creatures, Florida law prohibits swimming with dolphins as well as touching or feeding them. Officers from the Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission are on the water to ensure that these rules are followed. However, you may be lucky enough to have dolphins approach the tour boat quite closely, giving you an excellent view and great photo opportunity. If you would really like to have the possibility of encountering wild dolphins in the water, taking one of our Shell Island Snorkel Tours is a good option as the dolphins sometimes swim near snorkelers.</p><p>Dolphin & Snorkeling Tours Panama City Beach is a memorable experience in the beautiful Gulf of Mexico. Our tours will take you to the island to get as close as possible with the dolphins. It is an unforgettable experience. We will make stops on the island during our tours for snorkeling and shelling exploration.</p> </div>

<div><p>Shell Island and St Andrews Bay are fascinating places to explore. Snorkeling in the grass flats, shallows, and rocky islands is fun for all ages. We offer personalized tours and small groups for an unforgettable wildlife adventure. This tour is all inclusive! We are family fun experts and have been doing so for over 30 years.</p><p>Dolphins inhale air through the blowhole on their tops. It is possible for dolphins to experience respiratory irritation, which could cause symptoms similar to a person coughing or sneezing. This coughing experience, however, is known as chuffing in dolphins.</p><p>Tail slapping is a pretty obvious behavior. Dolphins will slap the water with their tails to stun other fish. Kerplunking can be a fun behaviour and is named for what it sounds like.</p> <b>Recommendation</b></div>
